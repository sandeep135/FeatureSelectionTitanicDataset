# FeatureSelectionTitanicDataset
In this notebook, we build various feature selection technique like Variance Threshold, SelectKBest,
SequentialFeatureSelector,RFE,Regularization,Random Forest Importance which help to choose which indepedent variable best for prediction on titanic dataset.
Then we build logistic regression, decision tree, and polynomial features to predict survival on the titanic.
